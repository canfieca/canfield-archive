Number one priority right now is to get the exifdata in the MongoDB.

I'm thinking this can be achieved by sorting out the datetime original into different collections and then have photos in the datetime original be located in those directories.

Once that's complete I'll be able to load the side navigation with the years for quick sorting mechanisms.

In conjunction with that I need a way to get the presigned URL to display to the front end. I must research solutions for that.

After that's complete I need to add user authentication functionality. Only allow specific members to view the photos that I approve.

Then once that's complete I can add mobile responsive design functionality and that's completed the beta of the project for now.

In the future, let's say when I have my own NAS setup I can allow for User Upload.

UPDATE AS OF 04/23/25:

What have I completed from the previous list?

Got the exifdata into the MongoDB
Loaded the sidenav with the years from the MongoDB
I've implemented the presignedURL function

What I have left to do:

Complete user authentication.
As of right now I have a login page and a sign up page.
To do:

Figure out what middleware is,
Find out which auth library is best for my use case

Additionally,
Figure out how to make my S3 API accessible from the production app.
